# Hawthorne

Hawthorne is a project aimed to provide an easy and modern way to interact with _currently_ source engine based games.

Hawthorne uses [Semantic Versioning][1], which means that _0.x.x_ is currently the unstable beta version - where things can drastically change from one point release to another, with the planned 1.x.x release cycle the product will be stable.
