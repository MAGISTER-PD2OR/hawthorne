# Hawthorne

Hawthorne is a project aimed to provide an easy and modern way to interact with _currently_ source engine based games.

> Hawthorne uses [Semantic Versioning][1].

0.x.x is the beta version, while beginning from 1.x.x a full release is planned.

The current version is **v0.7**.

*more may come later*

We have one huge [wiki](https://docs.hawthorne.in) and an [api](https://api.hawthorne.in) documentation.

How to install? It is simple as one command!
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/indietyp/hawthorne/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

You just need a webserver and a database. Make sre to check out the [documentation](https://docs.hawthorne.in) for more detailed information and an [getting started guide](https://docs.hawthorne.in/#/getting-started)
