# Quickstart

The API is the primary way to interact  with the application. It gathers information that can be used in other systems. The api is in the subpath `/api/v1`. It requires authentication over basic means. With over 120+ permissions the permissions that are required or used can be very granular, please keep this in mind.

The API is in itself stable, should there be a major revision and a new version will be issued. (e.g. `api/v2`), **and in the next major point release the old API endpoint removed**.
