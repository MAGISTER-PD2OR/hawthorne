# Quickstart

The toolchain is an effort to ease the maintenance of the project and itâ€™s dependencies in an one command fashion. This enables us to do several things that otherwise would take multiple steps. Example: Different system types.

To continue please refer to the [usage][1] or [reference][2] guide.

This toolchain may not have a constant conforming interface. _Breaking changes will only occur on major revisions point release_

!> **Note:** This is a /bin/sh script. The syntax may differ from certain shells, like fish - so be aware of that. (A [Hashbang] is included in ever shell file.)
