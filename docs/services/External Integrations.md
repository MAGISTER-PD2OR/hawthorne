## Import

You can import from many different similar systems using a simple command. Beware that due to the nature of the operation this can take _hours_ to complete. Using something like `screen` is recommended.

```bash
python3 manage.py import --mode <mode> --host <host> --user <user> --password <password> --database <database>
```

<mode> can either be sourceban, boompanel or sourcemod
<host>, <user>, <password>, <database> are all the credentials used for the MySQL database
